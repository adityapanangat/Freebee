Freebee is a website that acts a digital marketplace but for donations.

Unlike other websites where users simply list objects as free and put prices in the description, everything on Freebee is actually free.

The website allows users to accept and give out donations. It incentivizes users to donate by paying them with money that Freebee earns from ad revenue. 

Moreover, Freebee keeps users as safe as possible by not releasing any of their contact information unless it is authorized by the owner of the contact information.

This project is still underway, but the backend (serversie) is fully complete. If anyone is interested in helping me with frontend (clientside UI/UX), please let me know!
