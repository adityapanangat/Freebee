IMPORTANT THING TO DO: //**

today:
- how to make <a> href open in new tab

LONG TERM:
- the confirmers have their confirmed freebies put into the database
- email verification

- post verification
- hashed passwords
- error handlig
- try catch for every query database
- check for robot
- change domain name 
    in many areas like in client_side.js, 
    search autocorrect.js 
    and in .env file
- change search so that when there are no spaces, it still autocorrects. some ML system maybe?
- MAKE IT SO THAT FOR USERES TO CONTACT ITS LIKE HELP@FREEBEE.ORG OR SOMETHING
- ... for productName wherever it appears (settings, thumbnails etc)
- fix all fetch errors
- set up login if authentication failed shows something on screen
- how to make sure that others can just do get requests in order to get confirmation links for products

SAFETY: 
- FUNCTION NEEDED IN PRODUCTS POST IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FILE SAVED ISN'T MALICIOUS GIVEPAGEROUTER.JS
- build system to handle errors
- make sure the tempUploads folder gets cleared out??

TO DO: 
- transition history/blocking mechanism
- NEED TO CHECK WHETHER OR NOT OFFER IS IN ACCEPTED DATABASE BEFORE ACCEPTING
- email verificaiton
- make it so that all the product input fields are required
- make sure that the blob is retrievable in a normal way
- standardize all searching stuff to just lowercase, and emails to just lowercase, too
- add mobile version for product thumbnail creation
- options for getting
    - *note: accepter accepts, gets phone number/email
    - gets moved into accepted DB
    - incentive for donor to continue: donor needs to enter acceptor's password/accepter needs to go to confirmation link
    - acceptor can be reported for not giving password
- need to make sure that donationAccepted is ONLY able to be accessed by accounts that have accepted it after it has been accepted one time
- make it so that you can not create an account if your account emaill already exists
- allow user to remove something they have put up for donation
- make it so that after email verification, tells you that your account was created
- make it so that toReturn transfers over from logIn to signUp
- make it so that returnTo is saved in session storage
- get rid of accepted freebies
- create batch session saves
- add support in emails
- also add how to confirm reception?
- reporting is restricted for some reason
-confirm from email isn't working

TMRW:
- figure out a way to make it so that the search is available by query and by original loadup, 
finished off by trying to make dynamic html
- if donated, can't accept own donation
- clear received product from database
- post validation
- TEST creation of product
- EMAIL when item is unaccepted/unlisted. Email sent on accepting donation
